				<p>The Harish-Chandra Research Institute (HRI) was established in 1975, under the name Mehta Research Institute, as a result of a generous benefaction from the Mehta Trust. In its early years the institute operated as a small centre for fostering research in the Mathematical Sciences. A major turn took place in 1992 when the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) of the Government of India decided to fund the institute, and activities began to expand at a rapid pace. In the short span since then, HRI has emerged as one of the leading institutes in India for research and post-graduate training in Mathematics and Theoretical Physics. At present the institute has around 30 permanent faculty members, around 30 postdoctoral fellows, and 150 Ph.D students at any given time. The Physics research at HRI focuses on astrophysics, condensed matter, high energy physics, quantum information, and string theory. The Mathematics research is mainly on algebra, analysis, geometry, and number theory.</p>
